# The Basilisk

The Basilisk is a Harry Potter themed version of the classic game of "Snake". It includes two Game modes: Enter the Chamber of Secrets (Single Player) and Challenge a Friend (Multiplayer)

# Enter the Chamber of Secrets!
Your Classic game of Snake. You play as "The Basilisk" and your objective is to collect the dot. You will be awarded a point for each one you at. Try to beat your High Score!

# Challenge a Friend!
This Game mode adds a twist to the original game. It is based on the "Tron Legacy" arcade game but, includes a different way to win. 

Challenge your friend to a multiplayer battle. Each time you eat, your opponent loses a piece of tail. If your opponent loses all of his body, you win. Avoid crashing into the walls or your opponent for, this will kill you. Have Fun!

This game is a modification of base code for an implementation of Snake for my Advanced Programming Course Fall 2018. I received a Certificate of Excelence for this project.
